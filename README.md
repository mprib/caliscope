## About
`Caliscope` is a GUI-based multicamera calibration package.
When the intrinsic (focal length, optical center, and distortion) as well as extrinsic (relative rotation and translation) properties of a set of cameras are known, synchronized frames from those cameras can be used to triangulate landmarks identified across their multiple points of view.
With more cameras, this 3D tracking becomes more robust to occlusion and the inevitable errors in 2D landmark tracking and camera property estimates.

While OpenCV provides straightforward functions for the estimation of single camera intrinsic properties as well as estimates of the extrinsic properties of two cameras, there is no straightforward way to estimate extrinsic properties for more than two cameras.
Performing this requires [bundle adjustment](https://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/items/bundle_adjustment.html), which demands an extensive series of computational steps and intermediate data tracking.

Caliscope automates this more complex calibration function along with providing visual feedback regarding parameter estimates at each stage of processing.
Additionally, there are sample implementations of a Tracker class using Google's Mediapipe that demonstrate the capacity to integrate the full calibration results with landmark tracking tools to achieve 3D pose estimation.
While Mediapipe pose estimation has limitations regarding accuracy and precision, it demonstrates a data processing pipeline that can easily integrate more powerful tracking tools as they emerge.

This README provides a general overview and quick guide to install `Caliscope` on your system.
For a more detailed description of the calibration process and workflow, please see our [docs](https://mprib.github.io/caliscope/).

**For a quick sense of how the calibration process works, check out the [video walk through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voE3IKYtuIQ) of the [sample project](https://mprib.github.io/caliscope/sample_project/).**

*`Caliscope` was used to calibrate the cameras used in the above recordings (both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters), run 2D landmark estimation across all the videos using Holistic Mediapipe pose estimation, then triangulate the 3D landmark positions based on the camera system calibration.

# Quick Start

Basic installation instructions can be found [here](https://mprib.github.io/caliscope/installation/).
Please note that given the size of some core dependencies (OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PySide6 are among them) installation and initial launch can take a while.


For a basic overview of the entire workflow, please see the [sample project](https://mprib.github.io/caliscope/sample_project/) for an example dataset and a video demonstration of the complete workflow.

# Key Features

## Calibration board creation
- Easy creation of `png` files for ChArUco calibration boards
- board definition can be changed across intrinsic and extrinsic calibration allowing greater flexibiltiy

## Intrinsic Camera Calibration
- Automated calculation of camera intrinsic properties from input video
  - Optical Center
  - Focal Length
  - Lens Distortion

- Visualization of distortion model to ensure reasonableness

## Extrinsic Camera Calibration
- Automated bundle adjustment to estimate 6 DoF relative position of cameras
- Visualizer to inspect the estimates from the bundle adjustment
- Setting of the World Origin within the visualizer to simplify data processing


## 3D Tracking
- Tracker API for integrating alternate tracking methods
  - 3 sample implementations with Google Mediapipe (Hands/Pose/Holistic)
- Automated application of landmark tracking to synchronized videos
- Triangulation of 3D landmark position based on calibrated cameras
- Gap-filling and butterworth filtering to smooth trajectory estimates

## Trajectory Output

- output to `.trc` file format for use in biomechanical modelling
- output to tidy `.csv` format with well-labelled headers for straightforward integration with other workflows
- companion project [Rigmarole](https://github.com/mprib/rigmarole) in development to facilitate creation of animated rigs in Blender


## NOTE: Currently only using Mediapipe

Google's Mediapipe provides a relatively easy and efficient method for human subject tracking, though for many uses it is limiting.
Caliscope has a general Tracker base class that is implemented in a few versions (Pose/Hands/Holistic).
This has provided a proof of concept implementation of markerless tracking, though for more robust use the roadmap calls for integration with more powerful tools such as [MMPose](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose), [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut), and [SLEAP](https://github.com/talmolab/sleap).

# Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by [FreeMoCap](https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap) (FMC), which is spearheaded by [Jon Matthis, PhD](https://jonmatthis.com/) of the HuMoN Research Lab.
The FMC calibration and triangulation system is built upon [Anipose](https://github.com/lambdaloop/anipose), created by Lili Karushchek, PhD.
Caliscope was originally envisioned as an alternative calibration tool to Anipose that would allow more granular estimation of intrinsics as well as visual feedback during the calibration process.
Several lines of of the original Anipose triangulation code are used in this code base, though otherwise it was written from the ground up.
I'm grateful to Dr. Matthis for his time developing FreeMoCap, discussing it with me, pointing out important code considerations, and providing a great deal of information regarding open-source project management.
