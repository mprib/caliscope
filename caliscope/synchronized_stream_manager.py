    The primary job of the SynchronizedStreamManager is to take in a directory of concurrently recorded video
    as well as a Tracker and produce the xy.csv file that is the foundation of both the extrinsic calibration
    as well as the point triangulation.

    Related to this, it also directs where the recorded data will go and builds the DictionaryFrameEmitter
    that will broadcast a dictionary of frames while they are being processed.

    Because of this it has substantial and broad responsibilities that include creation of:
    - streams
    - synchronizer
